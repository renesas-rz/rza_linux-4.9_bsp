=== Modifying Graphic Layers at run-time ===
It is possible to modify the graphic layers after boot.
At run-time, you will find the follow sysfs file:

	RZA1: ch0 = /sys/devices/platform/fcff7400.display/
	      ch1 = /sys/devices/platform/fcff9400.display/

	RZA2: ch0 = /sys/devices/platform/fcff7400.display/

They will show the current settings for the graphic layers.

You can see that by doing:
$ cat /sys/devices/platform/fcff7400.display/layer2

For example:

$ cat /sys/devices/platform/fcff7400.display/layer2
xres = 800
yres = 480
x_offset = 0
y_offset = 0
base = 0x80000000
bpp = 16
format = RGB565
read_swap = swap_32_16
blend = 0



To modify any or all of these values, simply pass them back to that same file with new values.
The values must be either separated by a newline, or by a comma.

For example:
  $ echo "x_offset = 100 , y_offset = 100" > /sys/devices/platform/fcff7400.display/layer2
  $ echo -e "x_offset = 100 \n y_offset = 100" > /sys/devices/platform/fcff7400.display/layer2

Example:
$ cat /sys/devices/platform/fcff7400.display/layer2 > /tmp/layer2.txt
$ vi /tmp/layer2.txt
$ cat /tmp/layer2.txt > /sys/devices/platform/fcff7400.display/layer2


When choosing a format, below are the valid strings you can pass:
	RGB565
	RGB888
	ARGB1555
	ARGB4444
	ARGB8888
	CLUT8
	CLUT4
	CLUT1
	YCbCr422
	YCbCr444
	RGBA5551
	YCbCr422_0		(Cb/Y0/Cr/Y1)
	YCbCr422_1		(Y0/Cb/Y1/Cr)
	YCbCr422_2		(Cr/Y0/Cb/Y1)
	YCbCr422_3		(Y0/Cr/Y1/Cb)
	YCbCr422_4		(Y1/Cr/Y0/Cb)
	YCbCr422_5		(Cr/Y1/Cb/Y0)
	YCbCr422_6		(Y1/Cb/Y0/Cr)
	YCbCr422_7		(Cb/Y1/Cr/Y0)


When choosing a 'read_swap', below are the valid strings you can pass.
See register bits GRx_FLM:GRx_RDSWA in the hardware manual for more details.
	no_swap
	swap_8
	swap_16
	swap_16_8
	swap_32
	swap_32_8
	swap_32_16
	swap_32_16_8
NOTE: Make sure 'read_swap =' is specificed after 'format =' (since 'format' always set GRx_RDSWA to 0 (no_swap))
